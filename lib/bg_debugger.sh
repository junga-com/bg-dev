# Library bg_debugger.sh
# This library provides a debugger stub that is embedded in scripts so that they can be debugged with an interactive debugger.
#
# This library is not typically loaded by default or explicitly. bgtraceBreak and the configuration set by bg-debugCntr will cause
# it to be loaded on demand only when debugger is invoked by one of those features and the the host environment allows it. If the
# host environment is not in development mode (/etc/bgHostProductionMode contains mode=development) this library will refues to load
#
# This library contains only the core 'stub' code of the debugger. This code is independent of the debugger front end and manages
# the DEBUG trap that will 'enter' the debugger when a condition is met. _debugSetTrap() will install the DEBUG trap with a
# particular condition. _debugEnterDebugger() is the function that is called when the DEBUG Trap condition decides to enter the
# debugger. It has a loop that implements messages that an interactive debugger can send to the embedded stub to perform actions
# and query state.
#
# This library will identify and load a front end driver that provides for debugger UI. Two drivers are provided at this time (circa
# 2022-10).
#
# Activating the Debugger:
# First of all, the script must be running on a host that is authorized for development by having the file /etc/bgHostProductionMode
# contain the line 'mode=development' in order for the debugger to be available.
#
# There are several ways to activate the debugger.
#       bgtraceBreak  : inserting a call to bgtraceBreak is like hard coding a breakpoint in the script. When it is executed the
#                       debugger will be started using the driver configured in the bgDebuggerDestination environment variable.
#       bgdb <scriptname> [<p1>..<pN>] : When bg-debugCntr is active in a terminal, adding the 'bgdb' prefix when launching the
#                       scipt will cause it to invoke the debugger and stop on the first command of the script (after libraries are
#                       loaded)
#       cntr-c        : You can use 'bg-debugCntr debugger cntr-C:on' to make it so that pressing cntr-c during the scripts
#                       run will cause it to stop in the debugger on the next bash command. Note that if the script is blocked in
#                       an external command, it wont work because bash never gets to the next command.
#       stopOnAssert  : You can use 'bg-debugCntr debugger stopOnAssert:on' to make it so that the script will stop in the debugger
#                       if an unhandled assertError is 'thrown'
#
# Integrated Driver:
# The integrated debugger front end driver implements a debugger UI entirely in bash. It only needs a TTY on which to display the
# UI and accept user input. Its configuration parameter (dbg destination ID is 'integrated:<param>') specifies which TTY to use.
# Typically it will create a new cuiWin ('integrated:<param>') or it will use the alt page of the TTY the script is running in
# ('integrated:self')
# Use 'bg-debugCntr debugger destination integrated:self|cuiWin' to select this destination.
# See man(7) bg_debugger_integrated.sh
#
# Atom Driver:
# (not related to Kylo Ren). The Atom debugger front end driver interfaces with the bg_bash_debugger Atom package (i.e. plugin) to
# provide the UI in the Atom code editor.
# When the plugin starts in a Atom window, if the 1) it was launched from a terminal where a sandbox is vinstalled and 2) that
# sandbox folder is openned as an Atom project node, it will create name pipe at /tmp/bgAtomDebugger-$USER/<sandboxFolder>-toAtom
# Then if the debugger is activated in a script which was launched in a folder where that same snadbox folder in vinstalled, it
# will see that Atom window as an available debugger destination.
# Use 'bg-debugCntr debugger destination atom:' to select this destination.
#
# Debugger Front End API:
# A driver is a bash library that is named bg_debugger-<driverName>.sh and implements the following required functions.
#    _dbgDrv_debuggerOn <terminalID> : initialize the front end. <terminalID> is the parameter part of the debugger destination
#                                      .e.g. <driverName>:<terminalID>
#    _dbgDrv_debuggerOff             : clean up resources used by the debugger.
#    _dbgDrv_enter                   : initiate a 'breakSession' which exists for the duration that the script is stopped at a
#                                      particular location.
#    _dbgDrv_leave                   : end the 'breakSession'. The script will resume until the next break or it ends.
#    _dbgDrv_getMessage              : while stopped in a breakSession the stup loops calling this funtion. The driver's implementation
#                                      typically blocks waiting for user input an then returns the msg to the stub. If the message
#                                      indicates that the script should continue, the stub will then call the leave API.
#    _dbgDrv_scriptEnding            : indicates that the script is exitting. This is typically sent while there is not a break session.

# usage: debuggerOn [--driver=<driver>[:<destination>]] [<stepType>|firstLine|libInit|resume]
# This will cause the configured debugger driver to be loaded and the initial break condition to be set. In most cases this means
# that after this command, a DEBUG trap handler will be set in the proccess and every subsequent script command will be tested to
# see if the condition is met to invoke the interactive debugger at that point.
#
# Params:
#    <stepType> : this is passed through to the _debugSetTrap function. See that function for details.
#
# Options:
#    --driver=<driver>:<destination> : override the driver and destination. The driver determines the code that is loaded in the
#           script's process to handle debugger events and actions. The <destination> is a driver specific token that specifies
#           where the debugger UI will be displayed.  At the time of this writing, there are two drivers,
#           'integrated'  and 'remote'. See man(7) bg_debugger_integrated.sh and man(7) bg_debugger_remote.sh
#
#    --logicalStart+<n>  : this adjusts where the debugger should stop in the script. By default it will stop at the line of code
#                          immediately following the debuggerOn call. However, if debuggerOn is called in another library function
#                          it might not want to stop inside that function but instead at the line following whatever called it.
#                          <n> represents the number of functions to skip. +1 means go up one function from where debuggerOn is
#                          called.
# See Also:
#    debuggerOff   : releases the connection between the script and the active debugger. It can be reconnected with debuggerOn.

}

# usage: _debugEnterDebugger [<dbgContext>]
# This enters the main loop of an interactive debugger. It must only be called from a DEBUG trap because it assumes that environment.
# The DEBUG trap handler is set by _debugSetTrap which creates a handler that calls this function whenever the condition hard coded
# into the trap handler is met. Each time this function returns, it calls _debugSetTrap to setup the condition that will return to
# the debugger when met. Typically that means that a DEBUG trap with the condition embedded will be installed but if the step action
# is 'resume', then no DEBUG trap will be set so that the script will continue running unmonitored until it ends or a bgtraceBreak
# command in the script is reached.
#
# Stub and Drivers:
# This function is part of the debugger stub that is ran inside the script being debugged. It is a coreOnDemand library so it is
# only loaded if the script calls bgtraceBreak or the debugger is actived in another way. It will refuse to load in a production
# environment that implements security constraints on installed scripts.
#
# Break Sessions:
# This function implements what happens when the DEBUG trap decides that its time break for the debugger. The duration of this
# function is a 'break session'.
#
# This function interacts with the debugger front end (which is defined by the debug driver identified and loaded during debuggerOn())
# by calling _dbgDrv_enter(), then looping on _dbgDrv_getMessage(), and then when the loop finishes_dbgDrv_leave before returning
# which ends the DEBUG trap that called this function, letting the script continue to run.
#
# The handling of msgs returned by _dbgDrv_getMessage() define the actions that the front end can control in the script.
#
# Back End (script side) Commands:
# Commands use the format of any shell command -- <cmdName> [<p1>..<pN>]
# Newlines in parameters should be avoided or escaped as some drivers assume one line commands in this direction.
#
# Commands that control execution of the script
#    stepIn    : if the current command is a bash function call, descend into it and break at the top of the function
#    stepOver  : run the current command and then break again
#    stepOut   : run until the current function returns
#    skipOver  : move execution pointer to the next command without executing the current command
#    skipOut   : do not execute the remaining cmmands in the current function and stop at the line following the function call
#    resume    : run the script until it either concludes or executes an embeded bgtraceBreak call
#    rerun     : cause the script to exit immediately but then restart the script to continue debugging at its start
#    endScript : cause the script to exit prematurely
#
# Commands that configure the debugger state
#    stepOverPlumbing : cause the break logic set by _debugSetTrap to not break on commands that are considered 'plumbing'. For
#                       example, when stepping into an object method call, plumping is the _bgclassCall function which identifies
#                       and eventually calls the method's bash function. When stepOverPlumbing is configured, it will skip the
#                       _bgclassCall and all of its logic and step right into the method function.
#                       stepOverPlumbing is the default state.
#    stepIntoPlumbing : disable the stepOverPlumbing mechanism.
#
# Commands that mess with the script's state
#    reload : cause the script to reload itself or any bash libraries that are now newer. This may or may not work depending on
#             what changed in the scripts but often there is no harm in trying it if you are at a location that would take work to
#             get back too. The more robust way is to 'rerun' and then execute back to the desired point.
#
#    eval : run a command in the script's process space. For example 'eval myVar=5' will set the state of 'myVar' in the script to 5.
#
#    setFunctionBreakPoint <functionNameSpec> : dynamically patch all functions in the script process memory that match <functionNameSpec>
#           so that there is a call to bgtraceBreak as the first command in the function.
#           The step* family of commands install a custom DEBUG trap and then resumes the script. Before each simplae command the
#           trap code runs and determines if it time to break. That could work to stop when a function is called but the script
#           will run very slow until the break is found. The setFunctionBreakPoint is much faster because the script resumes without
#           any DEBUG trap installed and only stops if it executes a bgtraceBreak.
