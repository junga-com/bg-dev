Description: Tools to develop bg software packages
 bg-dev provides an environment for writing and maintaining various types of
 software packages. It makes it easy to create a minimal package and assets of
 various types that will be installed by the package. Asset Types include:
  * script commands - bash, php, etc...
  * script libraries - files used by script commands
  * script daemons -- long or short running commands that are controlled by
    this host's init system
  * man pages
  * plugins - files that extend the functionality of features provided by other
    packages
  * templates - files containing variable references that can be expended into
    final form
  * data - any file that will be installed on the target host and available for
    commands to use.
  * more... New asset types can be provided as PackageAsset plugins by third
    party packaes.
 See "man bg-dev" after installing to get started.
