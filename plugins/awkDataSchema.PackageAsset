# usage: bgAssetInstall_awkDataSchema <assetType> <file1>  [... <fileN>]
# This method is called to install assets of this type from a project folder into a target file system $DESTDIR/
# Params:
#     <assetType>  : the specific type of asset being installed. This is typically the type of this plugin class but it could be
#                    an annotated subclass so its passed in just in case.
#     <fileN>      : the filename relative to the project root of an asset being installed.
# Global Vars:
#     $DESTDIR    : the root folder the assets are being installed into. An empty string indicates that its being installed into
#                   the local host's filesystem directly. Typically this is set to a temporay staging folder in preparation to
#                   build an RPM or DEB package.
